     * Current implementation supports the following options:
     *
     * - heartbeat: the heartbeat interval in seconds
     * - tcp_nodelay: true/false, whether nagle should be disabled or not
     * - transport: the underlying transport to use (e.g. tcp, ssl, rdma)
     * - protocol: the version of AMQP to use (e.g. amqp0-10 or amqp1.0)
     *
     * (Note: the transports and/or protocols recognised may depend on
     * which plugins are loaded. AT present support for heartbeats is
     * missing in AMQP 1.0)
     *
     * - username: the username to authenticate as
     * - password: the password to use if required by the selected authentication mechanism
     * - sasl_mechanisms: a space separated list of acceptable SASL mechanisms
     * - sasl_min_ssf: the minimum acceptable security strength factor
     * - sasl_max_ssf: the maximum acceptable security strength factor
     * - sasl_service: the service name if needed by the SASL mechanism in use
     *
     * Reconnect behaviour can be controlled through the following options:
     *
     * - reconnect: true/false (enables/disables reconnect entirely)
     * - reconnect_timeout: seconds (give up and report failure after specified time)
     * - reconnect_limit: n (give up and report failure after specified number of attempts)
     * - reconnect_interval_min: seconds (initial delay between failed reconnection attempts)
     * - reconnect_interval_max: seconds (maximum delay between failed reconnection attempts)
     * - reconnect_interval: shorthand for setting the same reconnect_interval_min/max
     * - reconnect_urls: list of alternate urls to try when connecting
     *
     * The reconnect_interval is the time that the client waits for
     * after a failed attempt to reconnect before retrying. It starts
     * at the value of the min_retry_interval and is doubled every
     * failure until the value of max_retry_interval is reached.
     *
     * Values in seconds can be fractional, for example 0.001 is a
     * millisecond delay.
     *
     * If the SSL transport is used, the following options apply:
     *
     * - ssl_cert_name: the name of the certificate to use for a given
     * - connection ssl_ignore_hostname_verification_failure: if set
     *               to true, will allow client to connect to server even
     *               if the  hostname used (or ip address) doesn't match
     *               what is in the servers certificate. I.e. this disables
     *               authentication of the server to the client (and should
     *               be used only as a last resort)
     *
     * When AMQP 0-10 is used, the following options apply:
     *
     * - virtualhost: The name of the virtual host to work with.
     *
     * When AMQP 1.0 is used, the following options apply:
     *
     * - container_id: sets the container id to use for the connection
     * - nest_annotations: if true, any annotations in received
     *      messages will be presented as properties with keys
     *      x-amqp-delivery-annotations or x-amqp-delivery-annotations
     *      and values that are nested maps containing the
     *      annotations. If false, the annotations will simply be merged
     *      in with the properties.
     * - set_to_on_send: If true, all sent messages will have the to
     *      field set to the node name of the sender
     * - properties or client_properties: the properties to include in the open frame sent
     *
     * The following options can be used to tune behaviour if needed
     * (these are not yet supported over AMQP 1.0):
     *
     * - tcp_nodelay: disables Nagle's algorithm on the underlying tcp socket
     * - max_channels: restricts the maximum number of channels supported
     * - max_frame_size: restricts the maximum frame size supported
